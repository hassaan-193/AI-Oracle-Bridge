A natural language interface for Oracle databases powered by AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Chat with your database in plain English - no SQL required. Built with Python, Groq AI, and Oracle 23ai.

Oracle Database AI Assistant using Model Context Protocol
Developed an intelligent database interface that allows users to interact with Oracle databases using natural language instead of SQL queries. The system leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for structured tool communication and Groq AI (Llama 3.3 70B) for natural language understanding and query generation. Users can simply ask questions like "List all tables" or "Show employee data" and receive human-readable responses in seconds. Built with Python, implements read-only security controls, and demonstrates practical applications of AI in database management. Key technologies: Python, Oracle 23ai, MCP, Groq API, async programming.
